      <p><strong>Apostles' Creed:</strong></p>
      <p>
        I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.  
        I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
        born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried;  
        He descended into hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead;  
        He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;  
        from there He will come to judge the living and the dead.  
        I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints,  
        the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Nicene Creed:</strong></p>
      <p>
        We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth,  
        of all things visible and invisible. We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,  
        the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light,  
        true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father;  
        through Him all things were made. For us and for our salvation He came down from heaven,  
        was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary, and became man.  
        For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered death and was buried.  
        On the third day He rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; He ascended into heaven  
        and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,  
        and His kingdom will have no end.  
        We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son,  
        who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets.  
        We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.  
        We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.
